## FirePress Klimax

FirePress Klimax is an enhanced version of the original Casper theme made by the Ghost foundation. Our goal is to make a drop replacement of the orginal Casper theme by following updates and by not breaking anything from the original Casper.

We decided to make it available to everyone and open sourced at: https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Klimax

The version number [can be found in the package.json](https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Klimax/blob/master/package.json#L5)

## Features:

- Icons (font-awesome)
- Buttons
- Code Syntax (highlight) 
- and more to come

All detailed in the [release section](https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Klimax/releases).
